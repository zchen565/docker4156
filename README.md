### mysql-server 
- I didn't install mysql-server insided the docker
- the mysql-server is installed in the host machine
#### if you know how to connect to a mysql-server installed in the docker from the docker please notify me, I don't know how to set the docker port correctly
*********************************
- connecting the host mysql-server use host name / ip as "host.docker.internal"
- not 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0
- try mysql plugin from docker to connect, need add port 3306
- in code, it seems no need to add port "con = driver->connect("host.docker.internal", "root", "");"
*********************************


### ubuntu version is 20.04
I have trouble with 18.04 of some DYYNAMIC_ALLOC issue
